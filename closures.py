#  the values  passed to return_a_func() are still accessible to the new function  returned, even after the program has left the scope of return_a_func().

# Values get added to a function's closure in the order they are defined in the enclosing function (in this case, arg1 and then arg2), but only if they are used in the nested function. That is, if return_a_func() took a third argument (e.g., arg3) that wasn't used by new_func(), then it would not be captured in new_func()'s closure.
